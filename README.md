# Project Todos Console

Todos is a simple application to store and manage our todos, tasks, or activities. Just like Google Keep, Google Tasks, or generic todos app.

A complete Todos app should able to:

- Save or store todos, tasks, or activities
- Each todo can contains id, text, date of creation, tags, etc
- Show all todos
- Filter or search todos based on text, date of creation, tags, etc
- Add new todo with new text or tags
- Remove specific todo
- Update todo's text or tags

---

- Use multiple variables to contain variety of data types (string, number, boolean, array, object).
- Use multiple functions to process your todos application
